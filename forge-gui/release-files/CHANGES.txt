- Collector Number sort -
There's a new column in the deck editor to allow sorting cards in the same order used for assigning collector numbers. The column currently appears blank, but that's because we've hidden the relatively cryptic values it uses to sort. (Perhaps in a future release we'll put some meaningful visuals in the column.) When sorted by collector number, you'll see colorless non-artifact spells at the top, basic lands at the bottom, and all the in-between sorting goodness.

- Puzzle updates -
There are several new puzzles to play in this version, including two brand new tutorial puzzles which should get you up to speed on how puzzles work and what you commonly need to think about.

- Bug fixes -
As always, this release of Forge features an assortment of bug fixes and improvements based on user feedback during the previous release run.
