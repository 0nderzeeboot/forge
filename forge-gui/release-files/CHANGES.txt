- Puzzle Mode -
Many new puzzles were implemented, including several that start in combat with attackers declared and some that require you to survive for a certain set of turns.

- New Quest World: Caliman -
In Quest mode, a new world has been implemented by Xyx: Caliman, based on Portal: the Second Age. The author describes this new world in the following way.

Portal Second Age is the first official "Starter Level" set (a term not yet in use when the original Portal was released.) It outdoes its predecessor in easy-to-understand cards. Portal Second Age has a unique steampunk flavor that hasn't been replicated since, featuring firearms, steam engines and zeppelins. The open-ended story is staged in the Dominarian island of Caliman and focuses on the conflicts between the kingdom of Alaborn, the Talas merchant/pirates (some say there is no difference), the goblin tribes, the elves of Norwood forest and the nightstalkers created by the evil Tojira, swamp queen of Dakmor.

- Bug fixes -
As always, this release of Forge features an assortment of bug fixes and improvements based on user feedback during the previous release run.
