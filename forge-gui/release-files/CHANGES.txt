- Create a Puzzle -
A simple "create a puzzle" mode has been added, which presents you with a clean battlefield and allows you to use Developer Mode functions to set up the battlefield state for the puzzle. The "Dump Game State" dev mode command can then be used to save the state with a simple puzzle metadata template to a text file, which can then be hand-edited in a text editor to complete the puzzle file. Please note that you need Developer Mode to be enabled in Forge preferences for this mode to be of use. Also, very importantly, keep in mind that rule enforcement is active in this mode, so, for example, players will lose for drawing out of an empty library.

- Targeting Overlay -
The planeswalker attacker targeting arrows now use a distinct color from the blocker arrows, to make them easier to distinguish during a complex combat scenario. The default theme uses orange targeting arrows for this purpose, but they can be redefined in custom themes by editing sprite_icons.png (please consult the updated default file for details).

- Mobile Forge: Minimize on Screen Lock (option) -
A new option is available in Mobile Forge, which sends the game to background ("minimizes" it) when the screen is locked. This might help in case you are experiencing graphic issues (missing card pictures, black squares instead of font letters, etc.) after locking the screen for some time. This option is opt-in for now, and is thus off by default. This option and the fix were suggested by kevlahnota.

- Mobile Forge: Texture Filtering -
Texture filtering is now enabled by default for new Mobile Forge installations on Android. After extensive testing this mode has shown no noticeable performance downgrade on modern Android devices while offering a significantly higher quality of card rendering on the battlefield. Older installations will not be affected by this and you will still need to enable the feature manually if desired (in Forge preferences). If you are on a significantly older or low-end device and you are experiencing inadequately low game performance, please try disabling this option in case it is enabled on your installation.

- Developer Mode improvements -
The Developer Mode panel has been reorganized, many buttons were grouped by function. Several new functions have been added to make debugging and setting up game states easier: Add Card To Library/Graveyard/Exile, Repeat Last Add Card (which repeats whichever add card operation you have performed last automatically), Remove Card from the Game (which completely removes the card, leaving no trace, which may be useful if a card was added to the game by mistake).

- Bug fixes -
As always, this release of Forge features an assortment of bug fixes and improvements based on user feedback during the previous release run.
