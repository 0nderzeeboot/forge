- Bug fixes -
As always, this release of Forge features an assortment of bug fixes and improvements based on user feedback during the previous release run.
- M19 Core Set -
- Deck generation -
Deck generation now fully uses Latent Derichlet Allocation to learn deck archetypes.  The "card-based" random deck generation option is now replaced by this "archetype" based deck generation.  Random archetype decks can be generated for Standard, Modern, Legacy and Vintage.
Deck generation uses data from more sources to increase the number of archetypes available.
- Brawl -
Brawl banlist updated
- Starter Cube -
Added Card Kingdom starter cube
- Hand filtering option -
There is now an option in the settings to enable MTG Arena style hand filtering - this generates two starting hands for each player and selects the one with the closest to average land count (for the deck).
