- Guilds of Ravnica -
Most of Guilds of Ravnica has been implemented and is available in this release. We're working hard on getting the last few cards added.

- Token Changes -
Some work that streamlines tokens is going on under the hood. This may be the cause of missing/incorrect token images if you notice any, though we don't expect there to be any issues.

- Random Quest World -
Added Randomized Standard Quest World with LDA archetype generated decks as duels and standard card pool - this is designed so that there is always a quest world representing the current standard metagame - with a standard cardpool and decks generated using the LDA archetype based deck generation.  To access this mode, select the "Random Standard" world in the world selection dropdown.
In this world as well as the random duel opponents, there are randomly generated challenges of varying difficulty and of 2 different types.  One type pits your standard decks against modern, legacy or vintage opponents, the other gives the AI a standard deck, but with a headstart of one or more cards on the battlefield.

- Bug fixes -
As always, this release of Forge features an assortment of bug fixes and improvements based on user feedback during the previous release run.
