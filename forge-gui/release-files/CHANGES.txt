- Create a Puzzle -
A simple "create a puzzle" mode has been added, which presents you with a clean battlefield and allows you to use Developer Mode functions to set up the battlefield state for the puzzle. The "Dump Game State" dev mode command can then be used to save the state with a simple puzzle metadata template to a text file, which can then be hand-edited in a text editor to complete the puzzle file. Please note that you need Developer Mode to be enabled in Forge preferences for this mode to be of use. Also, very importantly, keep in mind that rule enforcement is active in this mode, so, for example, players will lose for drawing out of an empty library.

- Developer Mode improvements -
The Developer Mode panel has been reorganized, many buttons were grouped by function. Several new functions have been added to make debugging and setting up game states easier: Add Card To Library/Graveyard/Exile, Repeat Last Add Card (which repeats whichever add card operation you have performed last automatically), Remove Card from the Game (which completely removes the card, leaving no trace, which may be useful if a card was added to the game by mistake).

- Bug fixes -
As always, this release of Forge features an assortment of bug fixes and improvements based on user feedback during the previous release run.
