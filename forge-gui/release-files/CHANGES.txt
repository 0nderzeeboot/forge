- Java 8 -
Forge now requires Java 8 (1.8.0) as a bare minimum. If you haven't updated to this version of Java yet, you would need to do so before you are able to run this and all subsequent Forge releases. Forge is compatible both with Oracle Java 8 and with OpenJDK 8. If you're running the latest version of Java, but Forge does not run for you, check to make sure that you've uninstalled old versions. Additionally, check any JDK installations you have and ensure Forge is using the most up-to-date version.

- Optional More Duels Setting for Quest Mode -
In Quest Preferences, there is now an option called More Duel Choices which, when set to 1, makes the game produce additional duel choices from the lower difficulties. For example, at the Hard tier, you will still get an extra Easy and an extra Medium opponent to face.

- Foil Card Filter -
In the deck editor, there is now an additional Foil filter which allows one to sort cards by their foil overlay, choosing from three options: cards with the Modern style foil, cards with the Old style foil, and non-foil cards.

- Unconstrained ("Far") Set Unlocks in Quest Mode -
There are now two additional options in Quest Mode Preferences. "Allow Far Unlocks" allows the player to unlock any set, regardless of distance of the set (from the sets you currently have unlocked). "Unlock Distance Multiplier" is a multipler that gets applied for each step the set is further away, starting after the fifth. For example, if it's at the default of 1.25, that means, the first five sets on the list will have the default cost. The sixth costs 1.25 times more. The seventh costs 1.25^2 more, the next 1.25^3 and so on, the multiplier is capped at 500 to prevent overflow, but if there is demand for higher (default card price data has some crazy numbers, you can actually expect to be able pay the 2 million for the 500x multiplier), it can easily be changed to a different number before adding the patch. It's important to note that the order in the window counts. This means if you already did some "far" unlocks, your list might put sets you'd expect to be cheap at a high price. Why? Because with 3 distant sets, there are 3 times as many sets at a "near" distance to you, that get put in front of your intended set. So when doing far unlocks, keep that in mind and don't expect the set that was 5th on your list to stay there. It might get pushed down by another 5 or even more slots, as sets close to your new unlock are added to it.

- More Puzzles -
This release features over 30 puzzles to crack in Puzzle Mode. All the included puzzles rely on the features that Forge should support well, but because the mode is currently in its early development stages, some issues are to be expected. Please report any errors and inconsistencies you may find.

- Planar Conquest Updates -
A new plane is now available in Planar Conquest (Kaladesh), implemented by Sirspud. Also, if you have already unlocked all the planes, receiving a green reward on the chaos wheel will cause a Chaos Battle to start instead of awarding 5 planeswalker emblems.

- Hour of Devastation Pre-release -
This release contains all cards from the upcoming Hour of Devastation set. We did our best to fix the issues you reported so far with these cards, but there may still be more, so please consider these cards beta quality. Please test them if you'd like and provide feedback if you encounter any issues. These cards should only be visible and playable if Developer Mode is enabled in the game options.

- Bug fixes -
As always, this release of Forge features an assortment of bug fixes and improvements based on user feedback during the previous release run.
