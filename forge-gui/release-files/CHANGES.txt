- Optional More Duels Setting for Quest Mode -
In Quest Preferences, there is now an option called More Duel Choices which, when set to 1, makes the game produce additional duel choices from the lower difficulties. For example, at the Hard tier, you will still get an extra Easy and an extra Medium opponent to face.

- Foil Card Filter -
In the deck editor, there is now an additional Foil filter which allows one to sort cards by their foil overlay, choosing from three options: cards with the Modern style foil, cards with the Old style foil, and non-foil cards.

- Unconstrained ("Far") Set Unlocks in Quest Mode -
There are now two additional options in Quest Mode Preferences. "Allow Far Unlocks" allows the player to unlock any set, regardless of distance of the set (from the sets you currently have unlocked). "Unlock Distance Multiplier" is a multipler that gets applied for each step the set is further away, starting after the fifth. For example, if it's at the default of 1.25, that means, the first five sets on the list will have the default cost. The sixth costs 1.25 times more. The seventh costs 1.25^2 more, the next 1.25^3 and so on, the multiplier is capped at 500 to prevent overflow, but if there is demand for higher (default card price data has some crazy numbers, you can actually expect to be able pay the 2 million for the 500x multiplier), it can easily be changed to a different number before adding the patch. It's important to note that the order in the window counts. This means if you already did some "far" unlocks, your list might put sets you'd expect to be cheap at a high price. Why? Because with 3 distant sets, there are 3 times as many sets at a "near" distance to you, that get put in front of your intended set. So when doing far unlocks, keep that in mind and don't expect the set that was 5th on your list to stay there. It might get pushed down by another 5 or even more slots, as sets close to your new unlock are added to it.

- More Puzzles -
This release features over 30 puzzles to crack in Puzzle Mode. All the included puzzles rely on the features that Forge should support well, but because the mode is currently in its early development stages, some issues are to be expected. Please report any errors and inconsistencies you may find.

- New Counter Display -
Counters now have a new, text-based display option alongside the old counter images. It provides a textual overlay on top of each card (that has counters) showing all of the counters on the card with their names and exact counts, each type being displayed in a unique color. This can be customized to show only text-based counters (default), only the old style, both at the same time, or show the old image when cards are small to fit the textual display.

- Automatically Suggest Basic Lands in Deck Editor -
It is now possible to ask Forge to automatically suggest basic lands for your deck in the Add Basic Lands dialog of the deck editor. In desktop Forge, this is accomplished by double-clicking the statistics text in the bottom part of the dialog (hopefully someone will be able to code in a better, more intuitive way of doing this eventually). In mobile Forge, this is done by double tapping the statistics text. A tooltip is available in desktop Forge (and a hint text in mobile Forge) to make this feature more visible. Three deck sizes are supported by this algorithm: 40-card decks (if the number of cards in the main portion of the deck is less than 30, the algorithm will target a 40-card deck), 60-card decks (if the number of cards in the main portion is between 30 and 60, a 60-card deck will be targeted), and 100-card decks (if the deck is already above 60 cards when the feature is used, a 100-card deck will be targeted).

- Planar Conquest Updates -
A new plane is now available in Planar Conquest: Kaladesh. Also, if you have already unlocked all the planes, receiving a green reward on the chaos wheel will cause a Chaos Battle to start instead of awarding 5 planeswalker emblems.

- Java 8 -
As part of increased privacy protections (cardforge.org now uses SSL), the content downloaders now require a minimum Java version of 8u101. In the future, all of Forge will be updated to require Java 8. If you're running the latest version of Java, but Forge does not let you use the content downloaders, check to make sure that you've uninstalled old versions. Additionally, check any JDK installations you have and ensure Forge is using the most up-to-date version.

- Hour of Devastation Pre-release -
This release contains almost all cards from the upcoming Hour of Devastation set (except two). They are an early effort and may thus contain errors or provoke crashes. Please test them if you'd like and provide feedback if you encounter any issues. These cards should only be visible and playable if Developer Mode is enabled in the game options.

- Quest UI Improvements -
When selecting sets for a custom quest format, you can now hold shift and select two sets and it will select all sets between your two clicks. You can also now click on any part of a duel or event's box to select it; you don't need to click just the name/radio button anymore.

- Bug fixes -
As always, this release of Forge features an assortment of bug fixes and improvements based on user feedback during the 1.5.64 release run.
