- AI Improvements -
The AI has learned some new tricks in this version, which may be subtle but will hopefully surprise the player and make the game more exciting and challenging.
There is an ongoing effort to revise and update the AI playability status for the older cards supported by Forge. Many card scripts have been developed 5 or more years ago, when our artificial intelligence was a lot simpler and could not do many of the things it can do now. Therefore, many cards which are marked as "AI-unplayable" are, in fact, playable with the current engine. We aim to reevaluate the card scripts and mark the cards that are now playable by the artificial intelligence.

- Bug fixes -
As always, this release of Forge features an assortment of bug fixes and improvements based on user feedback during the previous release run.
