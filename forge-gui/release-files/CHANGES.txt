- Desktop GUI -
The Desktop GUI can pop up zones (Library, Graveyard, etc.) allow players to select cards from them when the option UI_SELECT_FROM_CARD_DISPLAYS is set.
The Desktop GUI outlines the selectable cards in many situations.  This is not done when playing mana costs.

- Digging -
Multi-card digging (e.g., for Genesis Wave) is done as a single multiple-card selection instead of a sequence of single-card selections.

- Game Night -
Support was added for the Game Night box set, including all 10 exclusive cards.

- AI improvements -
More AI improvements were implemented, hopefully making the game a little more interesting and challenging to play.

- Bug fixes -
As always, this release of Forge features an assortment of bug fixes and improvements based on user feedback during the previous release run.
