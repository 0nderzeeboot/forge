- Commander 2017 Spoiler Season -
Most Commander 2017 cards have been implemented and are ready for testing. Some of the remaining few unimplemented cards may be scripted in the future.

- Conspiracy -
Conspiracy and Conspiracy: Take the Crown are now available for drafting in Booster Draft mode. Support for Conspiracy is still somewhat experimental and is a little rough around the edges - in particular, choosing card names in the beginning of the game is a little awkward, not all Conspiracies are implemented, and the AI could use some improvement. Only 1v1 matches are available at the moment (like in any other Forge booster draft). Please note that because the "draft matters" cards are not yet implemented in Forge, drafting Conspiracy will feel largely incomplete, so please try this mode at your own risk and consider it a work in progress.

- Puzzle Mode -
Many new puzzles were implemented, including several that start in combat with attackers declared and some that require you to survive for a certain set of turns. Over 75 puzzles are available now in Puzzle Mode.

- New Quest World: Caliman -
In Quest mode, a new world has been implemented by Xyx: Caliman, based on Portal: the Second Age. The author describes this new world in the following way.

Portal Second Age is the first official "Starter Level" set (a term not yet in use when the original Portal was released.) It outdoes its predecessor in easy-to-understand cards. Portal Second Age has a unique steampunk flavor that hasn't been replicated since, featuring firearms, steam engines and zeppelins. The open-ended story is staged in the Dominarian island of Caliman and focuses on the conflicts between the kingdom of Alaborn, the Talas merchant/pirates (some say there is no difference), the goblin tribes, the elves of Norwood forest and the nightstalkers created by the evil Tojira, swamp queen of Dakmor.

- Card Zoomer Shortcut -
There is a new configurable keyboard shortcut available in desktop Forge: toggle card zoom on the current card (default "Z").

- Bug fixes -
As always, this release of Forge features an assortment of bug fixes and improvements based on user feedback during the previous release run.
