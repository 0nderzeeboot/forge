Online multiplayer functionality has been restored, but is still a Work in Progress. We do have a dedicated developer actively working on the online multiplayer feature.

"When you pay a cost" trigger for M19 cards don't work 100% correctly yet. We're still working on it.

Feel free to report your own there if you have any.
