Release Notes:
--------------

- Ultimate Masters -
This release fully supports Ultimate Masters, you can draft this brand new set in Booster Draft mode. Booster box toppers are not yet supported as a separate sealed product (the options for supporting them are currently being discussed), but otherwise the set is fully playable.

- Planar Conquest 25th MTG Anniversary / Christmas 2018 Update -
A rather serious and massive content update has happened in Planar Conquest. There are two new planes available, Dominaria and Kamigawa.
(Please note that Planar Conquest is currently only available on Android and in the mobile backport.)

** Dominaria **
It's the 25th anniversary year for Magic: the Gathering, and one of the key events this year was going back to Dominaria with a brand new set. So, at the end of the year, why not visit Dominaria once more? Dominaria is a plane which features cards from the eponymous set, Dominaria, as well as most (but not all) cards from Magic Core Set 2019 and Commander 2018. There are 45 events available for your enjoyment. Traditional Commander, Planeswalker, and Vanguard events represent the majority of the events on the plane, but Dominaria also features Planechase variant matches, with the planar decks consisting of plane cards representing regions of Dominaria (and sometimes, by the whim of fate, various other locations of the Multiverse) and various randomly inserted phenomena.
 There is a rumor circulating in the taverns claiming that somewhere on Dominaria there is a hidden secret portal leading to the legendary Time Vault which allows a planeswalker to travel to the past, yet it is unknown if this rumor is true.

** Kamigawa **
Kamigawa is a plane consisting of 45 events and containing the cards from Champions of Kamigawa, Betrayers of Kamigawa, and Saviors of Kamigawa. Even though this block is notorious for being underpowered and probably contains the biggest number of weenies and bears, it also presents you with a chance to get some of the most broken cards in the game. For example, you can grab Umezawa's Jitte without having to rely on randomly finding one in Chaos Battles. Commander, Vanguard, and the new Planechase events are available on the Kamigawa plane, but no Planeswalker events since no planeswalker cards existed in this period of Magic: the Gathering.

** Other changes **
In addition to that, several other planes were tweaked. In particular, Theros, Alara and Ravnica feature random Planechase matches replacing random non-variant matches. Ravnica has been updated to feature several new events featuring Guilds of Ravnica cards, and some old events on this plane were also updated with the new cards as well. Guilds of Ravnica has been fully enabled on this plane, so you can grab the relevant cards in The Aether or from randomly won booster packs. Also, Theros has been tweaked not to start with a hard non-singleton non-variant duel, as well as to allow to ignore non-singleton duels (walk around them) if need be.

- New Quest World: Tempest -
This release features a new quest world based on the Tempest block. This quest world was submitted by Seravy, it has now been fully tested and the AI support for the cards has reached the level where the duels in this world can be enjoyed as interesting, unusual, and challenging. This world contains 41 duels and 12 challenges. If you would like to revisit the older Magic experience, this may be just the quest world for you to try out.

- Possibility Storm Puzzles -
For all of you puzzle mode fans, the complete Guilds of Ravnica season of Possibility Storm puzzles is now implemented in Forge.

- AI Improvements -
A new round of AI improvements went into the game, hopefully making the game a little more interesting and exciting to play. In particular, certain improvements regarding Flash were implemented, the AI is now able to use cards which reorder the top of the library, such as Ponder or Portent, as well as cards which copy spells and/or activated abilities, such as Twincast or Fork. Some other cards were improved for the AI and some were marked as AI playable. On top of that, several logic-related bugs were fixed. Also, the AI has been optimized a little, hopefully making it a bit faster, especially on mobile platforms, in situations where there are a lot of cards on the battlefield but the AI has little or nothing to do.

- Random Commander Quest -
It is now possible to start a quest with Commander rules and randomly generated quest opponents playing Commander decks. This feature is currently exclusive to desktop Forge.

- Bug fixes -
As always, this release of Forge features an assortment of bug fixes and improvements based on user feedback during the previous release run.

Installation:
-------------

The Forge archive includes a MANUAL.txt file and we ask that you spend a few minutes reading this file as it contains some information that may prove useful. We do tend to update this file at times and you should quickly read this file and look for new information for each and every new release. Thank you.

The archive format used for the Forge distribution is ".tar.bz2". There are utilities for Windows, Mac OS and the various *nix's that can be used to extract/decompress these ".tar.bz2" archives. We recommend that you extract/decompress the Forge archive into a new and unused folder.

Some people use the Windows application 7zip. This utility can be found at http://www.7-zip.org/download.html. Mac users can double click on the archive and the application Archive Utility will launch and extract the archive. Mac users do not need to download a separate utility.

Once the Forge archive has been decompressed you should then be able to launch Forge by using the included launcher. Launching Forge by double clicking on the forge jar file in the past caused a java heap space error. Forge's memory requirements have increased over time and the launchers increase the java heap space available to Forge. Currently you can launch Forge by double clicking on the forge jar file without a java heap space error but this is likely to change as we add in more sounds, icons, etc.

- The Mac OS application version -
We haven't been able to distribute the OS X Application version of Forge in sometime. We've recently automated our release tools, and will continue to look in the viability of creating this file now that things are autoamted.


- Online Multiplayer -
For local network play you should only need two systems running Forge.  One to host and one to join and play.  For remote (over the Internet) play you will need to ensure that the port used (36743 by default) is forwarded to the hosting machine.
