- Dominaria -
This version of Forge features the initial implementation of the upcoming Dominaria set. All the cards are scripted. Please consider this early implementation of the set beta quality and be sure to report the issues you encounter while playing with the new cards. Two notable things about the set release: we haven't gotten all of the redirect planeswalker changes in yet. And booster generation does not currently guarantee a Legendary Creature.

- Multiplayer on Mobile Forge -
Mobile Forge now supports 3 and 4 player multiplayer matches in Constructed mode, you can select the number of players from the dropdown menu on the Constructed tab. Please note that matches with more than two players are more taxing for the mobile device and thus require more powerful hardware for prolonged gameplay without considerable slowdowns.

- Brawl format -
The new Brawl format is now available on Forge - selectable as a variant via checkbox on Desktop and in the variant dropdown on mobile

- MoJhoSto format -
The casual MoJhoSto format is now available on Forge. It's a variant of Momir Basic with three Vanguard avatars (Momir/Jhoira/Stonehewer).

- Deck generation tools -
Random AI deck generation now supports commander variants as well as standard and modern - these modes all now correctly limit AI playable cards when generating decks for AI.  Commander/TinyLeader/Brawl decks can be generated for a specific commander if you choose the "Random Commander Card-based Decks"

- New Puzzles: Rivals of Ixalan Possibility Storm -
Rivals of Ixalan season of Possibility Storm puzzles is now available on Forge.

- Format file specification -
Formats are now specified one-per-file in the res/formats folder - if you have your own custom formats, they should be moved into here following the same syntax

- Bug fixes -
As always, this release of Forge features an assortment of bug fixes and improvements based on user feedback during the previous release run.

Known Issues:
-------------


 Images for the latest sets will be available soon.

Online multiplayer functionality has been restored, but is still a Work in Progress. We do have a dedicated developer actively working on the online multiplayer feature.

Other known issues are here: https://git.cardforge.org/core-developers/forge/issues

Feel free to report your own there if you have any.

Installation:
-------------

The Forge archive includes a MANUAL.txt file and we ask that you spend a few minutes reading this file as it contains some information that may prove useful. We do tend to update this file at times and you should quickly read this file and look for new information for each and every new release. Thank you.

The archive format used for the Forge distribution is ".tar.bz2". There are utilities for Windows, Mac OS and the various *nix's that can be used to extract/decompress these ".tar.bz2" archives. We recommend that you extract/decompress the Forge archive into a new and unused folder.

Some people use the Windows application 7zip. This utility can be found at http://www.7-zip.org/download.html. Mac users can double click on the archive and the application Archive Utility will launch and extract the archive. Mac users do not need to download a separate utility.

Once the Forge archive has been decompressed you should then be able to launch Forge by using the included launcher. Launching Forge by double clicking on the forge jar file in the past caused a java heap space error. Forge's memory requirements have increased over time and the launchers increase the java heap space available to Forge. Currently you can launch Forge by double clicking on the forge jar file without a java heap space error but this is likely to change as we add in more sounds, icons, etc.

- The Mac OS application version -
We haven't been able to distribute the OS X Application version of Forge in sometime. We've recently automated our release tools, and will continue to look in the viability of creating this file now that things are autoamted.


- Online Multiplayer -
For local network play you should only need two systems running Forge.  One to host and one to join and play.  For remote (over the Internet) play you will need to ensure that the port used (36743 by default) is forwarded to the hosting machine.
