Whenever you attack, target opponent loses X life, where X is the number of artifacts you control.

Whenever chaos ensues, for each opponent, you create a 3/3 black Dalek artifact creature token with menace that attacks that opponent this turn if able. Those tokens gain haste. Sacrifice them at the beginning of the next end step.
