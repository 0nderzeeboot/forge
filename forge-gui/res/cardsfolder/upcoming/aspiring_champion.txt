Oracle:Menace\nRuinous Ascension — When Aspiring Champion deals combat damage to a player, sacrifice it. If you do, reveal cards from the top of your library until you reveal a creature card. Put that card onto the battlefield, then shuffle the rest into your library. If that creature is a Demon, it deals damage equal to its power to each opponent.
